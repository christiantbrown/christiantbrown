Some simple MERN Stack Development\
Pentesting with Kali Linux\

## Some of my projects

# [MERN Application to create Pokemon-Style cards](https://github.com/christiantbrown/card-creator)
A simple React application that allowed users to create a card by providing an image and some stats, and look it up later\
It was my first experience with JavaScript, React, and MongoDB. I quite literally learned the basics of MERN when creating this\
The search function needs work, the CSS definitely needs work, and the cards cannot yet be downloaded, but I learned a lot when making this so it served its purpose.\

# [exFAT File System Utility](https://github.com/christiantbrown/exfat-project-cse3310)
A project for my Fundamentals of Software Engineering class, done in C and some Bash
We were tasked with making a command line utility that could manipulate exFAT file systems, as well as writing automated system test and unit tests\
This was my first group Software project, and it taught me a lot about working with people of different strengths and skillsets\
The project had to be done through my academic GitHub, so the commit history was not preserved, but my contributions are listed in the updated project Readme\
